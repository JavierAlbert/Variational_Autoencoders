# Dense Autoencoders
We use a very simple 1 layer dense neural network to encode the images by a factor of 25 to later reconstruct them. 

# Deep Autoencoders
Here we still use a dense architecture but with 3 dense layers. 

# Convolutional Autoencoders
Here we use convolutional layers instead of dense layers.

# Denoising Autoencoders
Here we build a denoising convolutional autoencoder, using noisy image and not noisy image pairs to train the network.

# Variational Autoencoders
